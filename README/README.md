## Overview

This project checks and validates SSL certificates for domain names entered by users. The application comprises a React frontend and an Express backend. It displays information about the SSL certificate, including:
- Validity status
- Expiration date
- Issuer details
- Subject details
- Whether the certificate is valid for the input domain
- Whether the CA is valid
- Whether the certificate is self-signed
- CRL/OCSP status

## Setup and Run Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

- git clone <repository-url>
- cd ssl-checker/backend

2. **Install dependencies**:

- npm install

3. **Start the backend server**:

- node server.js
The backend server will run on http://localhost:5000.

4. **Frontend Setup**:
Navigate to the frontend directory:

cd ../frontend
Install dependencies:


npm install
Start the React application:

npm start
The React app will run on http://localhost:3000.

5. **Running the Application**:

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
Enter a domain name in the input field and click "Check SSL" to check the SSL certificate details.


### Functional Requirements

#### Frontend
- A single-page application using React.
- A user interface with:
  - An input field for users to enter a domain name.
  - A submit button to initiate the SSL certificate check.
  - A results section to display the certificate information and validation results.

#### Backend
- A RESTful API using Express.
- An endpoint that accepts a domain name and performs the following operations:
  - Fetch the SSL certificate for the given domain.
  - Extract metadata from the certificate.
  - Validate the certificate's expiry date.
  - Check if the certificate chain is valid.
  - Verify that the certificate is valid for the input domain.
  - Check if the certificate has been revoked.

### Display the Following SSL Certificate Information:
- Validity status
- Expiration date
- Issuer details
- Subject details
- Whether the certificate is valid for the input domain
- Whether the CA is valid
- Whether the certificate is self-signed
- CRL/OCSP status

### Implement Error Handling
- Display user-friendly messages for various error scenarios (e.g., invalid domain, network errors).

## Technology Choices

### Frontend
- **React**: Chosen for its component-based architecture, which facilitates the development of reusable and maintainable UI components.
- **CSS**: Used to style the application and ensure a clean, responsive, and user-friendly design.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend API. Axios is preferred for its simplicity and ease of use.

### Backend
- **Express**: Chosen for its simplicity and ease of integration. It serves as the backend server that handles API requests and SSL certificate validation.
- **HTTPS Module**: Utilized to fetch and validate SSL certificates from specified domains.
- **Node.js**: Provides an efficient server environment for handling asynchronous operations required to fetch SSL certificates.

## Assumptions and Design Decisions

- **Single-Page Application**: The frontend is designed as a single-page application (SPA) to provide a smooth and responsive user experience without page reloads.
- **Domain Input**: Assumes that users will input valid domain names. Basic validation is done, but no complex parsing of domains.
- **Error Handling**: Includes basic error handling for common issues such as invalid domain entries or network problems. However, more advanced error handling could be implemented.
- **SSL Validation**: The SSL certificate validation is done using Node.jsâ€™s native HTTPS module. Assumes that the domain has a publicly accessible SSL certificate.
- **CRL/OCSP Checks**: Basic checks are implemented, but for a production environment, more robust solutions like integrating with third-party APIs for checking revocation status could be considered.

## Known Limitations and Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CRL/OCSP Checks**: While basic checks are implemented, integrating a more robust solution could improve accuracy.
- **UI Enhancements**: The current UI is functional but minimalistic. Future improvements could include better visual appeal and more detailed error messages.
- **Performance Optimization**: The application works well for single domain checks. For checking multiple domains simultaneously, performance optimizations might be necessary.
- **Deployment**: The application currently runs locally. Deploying it to a cloud service such as Heroku or Vercel would make it accessible to a broader audience.
